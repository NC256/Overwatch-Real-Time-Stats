# What is this?

This project leverages the functionality of the Overwatch workshop to log statistical information about games in progress The information is then parsed by this program so that it can be analyzed or displayed, but currently it is just designed to send it to Google Sheets. I want to eventually let people analyze their own games and matches, but currently the hope is that esports broadcasts can use the spreadsheet output for use in broadcast overlays or similar.

# How do I use it?

The project is not yet done/ready yet. A minimum viable working and distributable version is one of my next goals.
